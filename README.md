Tries to determine how many dice to roll as a defender in the game of Risk given an attacker's rolls. This takes advantage of the rule that the attacker must roll first and then the defender _gets to choose_ how many dice to roll in response. If the defender chooses to roll only one die, then he will only lose one army if he loses.

## Example
Battle 5 attackers against 2 defenders many times for several selection methods. A matrix describing whether the defender will roll one or two dice (dependent on the attackers' rolls) is contained in `should_roll.txt`.

```
octave:1> [win_pcts, avg_atk_left, avg_def_left, atk_left_std, def_left_std] = run_risk_a_lot(5, 2)
win_pcts =

   0.78000
   0.88000
   0.89000

avg_atk_left =

   4.0513
   4.1818
   4.3371

avg_def_left =

   1.4545
   1.8333
   1.2727

atk_left_std =

   1.16103
   1.05640
   0.72212

def_left_std =

   0.50965
   0.38925
   0.46710
```

## Algorithm
The simulation will attack until either the territory is conquered or the attacker only has one army left and therefore cannot attack any more.

The dynamic matrix included was generated by looking at the probabilities of winning outright (i.e., losing no armies) by rolling either one or two dice as recorded in `o-vs-d.txt`. A decision matrix looks like:

```
     |  1   2   3   4   5   6
  ---+-----------------------
   1 |  2   2   2   2   2   2
   2 |  2   2   2   2   2   2
   3 |  2   2   1   1   2   2
   4 |  2   2   1   1   1   1
   5 |  2   2   2   1   1   1
   6 |  2   2   2   1   1   1
```
where the entry at `i,j` indicates how many dice the defender should roll given that the attacker's top two rolls are `i` and `j`. (Notice its symmetry.)

Another possibility for a decision matrix would consider the possibility that it may be advantageous to roll two dice when there is a fair chance of trading 1-and-1 during a battle. Such a decision could also depend on the number of armies the attacker and defender have left to spare and generally might make things much more complicated.

## Results

Some interesting preliminary results over 10,000 iterations given the dynamic matrix, a defender who always throws two dice when they're available, and a defender who always throws one die:

Successful conquer rate:
```
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
| Attack | Defense | Dynamic |   2  |   1  |
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
|      5 |       2 |    78.8 | 82.9 | 87.2 |
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
|     10 |      10 |    40.1 | 48.1 | 80.1 |
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
|     15 |      10 |    79.0 | 84.8 | 98.5 |
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
|     25 |      15 |    92.2 | 95.4 | 99.9 |
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
|     50 |      50 |    54.0 | 70.5 | 99.8 |
+--------+---------+---------+------+------+
```

Average armies the attacker has left when the territory is successfully conquered:
```
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
| Attack | Defense |   Dynamic  |      2     |      1     |
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
|      5 |       2 |  4.1 (1.0) |  4.0 (1.2) |  4.3 (0.8) |
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
|     10 |      10 |  4.9 (2.0) |  5.2 (2.0) |  5.8 (1.9) |
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
|     15 |      10 |  7.7 (3.0) |  8.0 (3.1) | 10.0 (2.6) |
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
|     25 |      15 | 12.1 (4.6) | 13.2 (4.7) | 17.3 (3.4) |
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
|     50 |      50 |  0.8 (5.9) | 12.7 (6.6) | 24.3 (6.1) |
+--------+---------+------------+------------+------------+
```

Average armies the defender has left when the territory is fully defended:
```
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Attack | Defense |  Dynamic  |     2     |     1     |
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|      5 |       2 | 1.6 (0.5) | 1.7 (0.4) | 1.3 (0.5) |
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|     10 |      10 | 4.5 (2.2) | 4.4 (2.2) | 3.0 (1.8) |
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|     15 |      10 | 3.4 (1.8) | 3.5 (1.8) | 2.2 (1.5) |
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|     25 |      15 | 3.4 (1.9) | 3.2 (2.1) | 3.2 (1.0) |
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|     50 |      50 | 8.9 (5.7) | 7.9 (5.5) | 3.3 (1.6) |
+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
